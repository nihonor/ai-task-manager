## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team Conversation

```javascript
POST /api/chat/conversations
{
  "name": "Development Team Chat",
  "type": "team",
  "participants": ["user1", "user2", "user3"],
  "teamId": "team123"
}
```

### Sending a Message with Reply

```javascript
POST /api/chat/messages
{
  "conversationId": "conv123",
  "message": "Great idea! Let's implement this.",
  "replyTo": "msg456",
  "mentions": ["user789"]
}
```

### Reacting to a Message

```javascript
POST /api/chat/messages/msg123/react
{
  "emoji": "üëç"
}
```

### Uploading a File

```javascript
POST / api / chat / upload;
// Form data with file, conversationId, and optional description
```

## File Storage

Files are stored in the `uploads/chat/` directory with the following structure:

- Unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- Original file extensions preserved
- File metadata stored in database
- Soft delete support for file cleanup

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Invalid file types/sizes
- Permission violations
- Missing conversations/messages
- Database connection issues
- File upload failures

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination for message retrieval
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- File size limits to prevent storage abuse
- Soft deletes to maintain data integrity
- Optimized conversation listing with last activity sorting
